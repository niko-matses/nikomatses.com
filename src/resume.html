								 <h2 class="main-content__headline">Design Skills</h2>

								 <h3 class="main-content__subhead">User Experience</h3>

								 <p class="main-content__paragraph">Learning and applying UXD has transformed the way I create digital products. Now, content audits, competitive analyses, user stories, wireframes and prototypes are just part of my UX repetiore.

								 <h3 class="main-content__subhead">Responsive / Web</h3>

								 <p class="main-content__paragraph">I began learning web design around the release of the first iPhone. For myself as well as the entire industry, adapting to the constraints of mobile browsing was a major turning point.</p>					

								 <h3 class="main-content__subhead">Graphic</h3>

								 <p class="main-content__paragraph">I majored in Visual Communications at Framingham State University. It was there I built a deeper understanding and appreciation for the principles of Graphic Design.</p>

								 <h3 class="main-content__subhead">Motion</h3>               

								 <p class="main-content__paragraph">My first animations were drawn on pads of Post-It notes. Since then I've applied motion design skills to projects from Flash to Premiere Pro, After Effects, CSS3 and JavaScript.</p>
							</section>
							<section class="section section__skills">
								 <h2 class="main-content__headline">Dev Skills</h2>

								 <h3 class="main-content__subhead">HTML5</h3>
								 <p class="main-content__paragraph">I like coding with as many elements in the HTML5 spec as I can, which means my markup is more semantic to fellow developers and better-suited for modern devices, browsers and search engines.</p>

								 <h3 class="main-content__subhead">SASS</h3>
								 <p class="main-content__paragraph">Who knew working with CSS could be so much fun? SASS has not only made coding-life easier, it's helped me grow as a front-end developer.</p>

								 <h3 class="main-content__subhead">Mobile</h3>
								 <p class="main-content__paragraph">Deveoping mobile-first, I device test and use BrowserStack for every web project. When I'm crafting responsive web pages, no screen size goes overlooked.</p>					

								 <h3 class="main-content__subhead">GIT &amp; Github</h3>
								 <p class="main-content__paragraph">I know my way around Terminal, GitHub.com and Git to collaborate with a team of developers.</p>

								 <h3 class="main-content__subhead">BEM</h3>
								 <p class="main-content__paragraph">Much like Brad Frost's Atomic Design, learning and using BEM in my markup has shaped the way I approach web design for the better.</p>

								 <h3 class="main-content__subhead">GULP</h3>
								 <p class="main-content__paragraph">Gulp and other task runners have shaved hundreds of hours from my development workflow. I use them for handling BrowserSync, concatenation, minification, templating, CSS prefixes, compiling SASS, and more.</p>
